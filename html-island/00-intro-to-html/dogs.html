    <h1>Dogs</h1>

    <p>
      The <b>dog</b> or domestic dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus
      familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is
      characterized by an upturning tail. The dog derived from an ancient,
      extinct wolf, [6][7] and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living
      relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[9][8] by
      hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[7] before the development of
      agriculture.[1]

    <p>
      Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large
      number of domestic individuals[10] nd gained the ability to thrive on a
      starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other candids.[11] Over the
      millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the
      human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.[12]
